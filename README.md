# Rem Waste Demo - Felix Baciu

Built using vite and it's react-typescript template.

Tried to keep things as simple as posible.

Used typescript for typing the endpoint response.

I considered using tailwind for styling but decided to go with good old css.

Used css modules for local scoping of styles.
